						<h2>MyCollege</h2>
						<p>   St. Ignatius of Loyola, after whom the college is christened, is the founder of the Jesuits along with 6 companions who were students of the University of Paris, known as the citadel of knowledge in the then modern world. It is the vision of this great Christian mystic and genius that has become crystalized in the educational philosophy and praxis of the Jesuit brand across the globe. St. Ignatius with his charism and his Spiritual Exercises inspires and gives shape to a new paradigm for education that seeks God in all things, promotes discernment and “engages the world through a careful analysis of context in dialogue with experience, evaluated through reflection for the sake of action and with openness always to evaluation.” (General Congregation Document of the Jesuits 35).
